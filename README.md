# Synesthesia Community Efforts

This is a place to share, discuss, request, track, and provide feedback for community efforts for [Synesthesia](https://synesthesia.live).

A central part of this repository is providing an overview of the world of Synesthesia, so links to other sources are not limited to the community's creations. Which also reduces the risk of reimplementing existing tools or frameworks by accident, group guides by tools or frameworks, and make users aware of some of the tools available.

## Contributing

The simplest way to contribute is to join the discussion in the existing [Discord community](https://discord.gg/dMVvCgXxtU) in the #tools and other #channels, or in [this repo's discussion tab](https://github.com/mattorp/synesthesia-community-efforts/discussions).

Other ways are to

- ask for, list, describe, expand on, ..., features/resources/ideas in the [issues](https://github.com/mattorp/synesthesia-community-efforts/issues),
- edit the [README](../README.md)
- or add new files for more in-depth information.

The #feature-suggestions channel in [Discord](https://discord.gg/dMVvCgXxtU) may prove an inspiration. Some of these features can be implemented outside Synesthesia, which lets the team focus on core features instead.
